# Inverted-Index-and-Wild-cards-in-Information Retreival

Goal : Taking my own source of files (should be a combination of doc, txt, pdf
and excel files, minimum of 25 files, each with minimum 300 words). Select the source
files in such a way that they belong to two different categories.

1.  Writing a function to construct a positional index for preprocessed documents (Tokenization, stop
word removal, stemming). Extend your inverted index implementation to use skip lists for
storing the lists of document IDs. Implement skip list insertion and search operations.
Compare the performance of search operations in the basic inverted index and the skip listenhanced inverted index. Use a set of sample queries to measure and compare the time taken for
searches. 
2.  Writing a function to use wild-card queries for terms that starts with ‘T’ and ends with ‘E’
